Objective is to descent the castle. Can be played in R and Python.

There are 3 versions of teh R script:
One allows you to play the game using base R packages only
The user needs to press enter for the keyboard input to be accepted

Another requires you to download keypress, which only works in the Terminal or Command Line
Keypress allows you to press a key and have taht key accepted as a variable without the user needing to press the enter key

Another version is for RStudio. In that script RStudio's API is used to constantly monitor the R console for user keyboard inputs
User inputs are accepted witout the use needing to press enter
